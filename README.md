## Application structure.

* React.js to create the interface;
* Redux for managing application state;
* React-router for routing
* Reselect to implement a filter, and remember expensive calculations;
* Redux-persist to save data to localStorage
* Material UI for forms and input fields and UI components;
* Didn't use Formik/React-hook-form because there was no point in form validation.
* Styled-components to separate the styles and architecture of the elements and make the components readable.
* Canvas.js for building a weekly chart with data;
